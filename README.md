## Description

This website is a simple 9-5 scheduler made for a homework assignment. You can use it to plan your day, and see what tasks are coming next.

## Usage

At the top of the page, the current date will be displayed. Below that is a series of blocks, with the corresponding hour to the left of each. If a block is in the future, it will be green. Red, for your current time, and grey for past events. To add to this list, simply click on a block, and type something in. To save what you have typed, make sure to click the save icon to the right of the block. The next time you reload, your ToDo items will be there waiting for you!
